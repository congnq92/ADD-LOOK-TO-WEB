# VERSIONING

THAT MEANS THAT WITH A **VERSION NUMBER X.Y.Z**:

WHEN RELEASING CRITICAL BUG FIXES, WE MAKE A **PATCH RELEASE BY CHANGING THE Z NUMBER** (EX: 15.6.2 TO 15.6.3).
WHEN RELEASING NEW FEATURES OR NON-CRITICAL FIXES, WE MAKE A **MINOR RELEASE BY CHANGING THE Y NUMBER** (EX: 15.6.2 TO 15.7.0).
WHEN RELEASING BREAKING CHANGES, WE MAKE A **MAJOR RELEASE BY CHANGING THE X NUMBER** (EX: 15.6.2 TO 16.0.0).
MAJOR RELEASES CAN ALSO CONTAIN NEW FEATURES, AND ANY RELEASE CAN INCLUDE BUG FIXES.

**MINOR RELEASES ARE THE MOST COMMON** TYPE OF RELEASE.

VERSION RELEASE:
- **MAJOR** | MAIN: **BREAKING CHANGES**.
- **MINOR** | MINI: **NEW FEATURES** OR **NON-CRITICAL FIXES** | **NEW FUNCTIONALITY** OR **IMPROVEMENTS**.
- **PATCH** :  **CRITICAL BUG FIXES**. | ??URGENT
